# tivalaunchpad_libraries
Tiva EK-TM4C123GXL libraries for UART and multiple ADC developed by Dmitrii Gusev, Simon Fraser University. Developed for MSE450 course project.
This code is not perfect whatsoever (I would say it is really bad because it does not utilize registers properly), but it works <3

## Supports:
- UART0
- UART5
- ADC PE2
- ADC PE3

All functionality can be used simultaneously.
